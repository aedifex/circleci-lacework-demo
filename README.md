# CircleCI && Lacework Demo
An example of using Lacework &amp; CircleCI to incorporate application security into your CI/CD pipelines by leveraging the "shift left" methodology.

### Okay, what exactly is shifting left?

Essentially incorporating software and application security into earlier junctures of the software delivery life-cycle, namely the building / testing phase, thus "shifting" left. Rather than security being a detractor to development speed and velocity, security becomes an enabler.
